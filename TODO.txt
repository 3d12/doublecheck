# TODO
1. Change Timezone on register and admin edit screens to a drop-down
2. Create user edit page for user to edit their own account parameters
3. Add moderation tools to posts so moderators and admins can regulate post content
4. Create admin log page, where all admin actions logged are displayed
5. Create user page, where games posted by user and games featuring user can both be seen
6. Implement game-level comments
  - Should see most recent X comments on the main page (along with "show more" button)
  - Should see whole list of comments on the view game page, and have textbox to add another
7. Implement member number into the new post page, allowing white and black to reference other users
  - This shouldn't just be member number, this should be using User.id behind the scenes but should
    ideally allow fuzzy matching and completion suggestions based on username and/or member #
8. Implement DTOs for cleaner integration to db backend
  - This can be done with python dataclasses
